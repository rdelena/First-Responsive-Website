          <h2>Impressionism (c. 1867-1886)-</h2>
          <p>
            In the late 19th century France, an art movement called
            Impressionism began to take foot in the art community, contrary to
            the rules of academic painting during that time. Impressionism
            paintings are characterized by their use of small, thin, visible
            brush strokes, capturing everyday moments, use of colors & tones
            without mixing the paint, and an absence of traditional drawings. It
            represents the affirmation of the freedom of individual expression
            of the artist.

          <h2>Post-Impressionism (c. 1886-1905)</h2>
          <p>
            The Post-Impressionism art movement was formed in opposition of the
            Impressionist stylistic use of naturalistic depiction of light and
            color, and the loss of structure in paintings. Post-Impressionism
            characteristics include the use of vivid colors, thick application
            of paint, distinctive brush strokes, and real-life subject matter,
            but they were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, to distort
            form for expressive effect, and to use unnatural or arbitrary color.

          <h2>Fauvism (c. 1905-1910)</h2>
          <p>
            The Fauvism movement was created by a group of modern artists with
            an emphasis on using strong color over representation, or realistic
            values, of Impressionism. Fauvism characteristics included the use
            of bold, vibrant colors used in unusual juxtaposition, and high
            applications of paint. Fauvist painters use recognizable imagery
            with chromatic dissonance to allow the color to convey meaning in
            itself without the outside connection to the depicted object.
