        <h2>Impressionism (c. 1867-1886)</h2>
        <p>
          In the late 19th century France, an art movement called Impressionism
          began to take foot in the art community, contrary to the rules of
          academic painting during that time. Impressionism paintings are
          characterized by their use of small, thin, visible brush strokes,
          capturing everyday moments, use of colors & tones without mixing the
          paint, and an absence of traditional drawings. It represents the
          affirmation of the freedom of individual expression of the artist.

        <h2>Post-Impressionism (c. 1886-1905)</h2>
        <p>
          The Post-Impressionism art movement was formed in opposition of the
          Impressionist stylistic use of naturalistic depiction of light and
          color, and the loss of structure in paintings. Post-Impressionism
          characteristics include the use of vivid colors, thick application of
          paint, distinctive brush strokes, and real-life subject matter, but
          they were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, to distort form
          for expressive effect, and to use unnatural or arbitrary color.

        <h2>Fauvism (c. 1905-1910)</h2>
        <p>
          The Fauvism movement was created by a group of modern artists with an
          emphasis on using strong color over representation, or realistic
          values, of Impressionism. Fauvism characteristics included the use of
          bold, vibrant colors used in unusual juxtaposition, and high
          applications of paint. Fauvist painters use recognizable imagery with
          chromatic dissonance to allow the color to convey meaning in itself
          without the outside connection to the depicted object.

        <p class="vangogh-bio">
          Dutch Post-Impressionist artist who emerged as one of the most famous
          figures in the history of Western art after his death. His innovations
